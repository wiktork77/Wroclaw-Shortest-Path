## üìå Project Objective  
The goal of this project was to **implement a public transport route search system for the city of Wroc≈Çaw**, utilizing two popular shortest path algorithms: **Dijkstra's algorithm** and the **A\* algorithm**, as well as data provided by the city of Wroc≈Çaw.  

---

## üìÇ Data  
The program is based on the **`connection_graph.csv`** file, located in the **`data_sources`** directory, which was created by merging datasets available from [**Open Data Wroc≈Çaw**](https://opendata.cui.wroclaw.pl/dataset/rozkladjazdytransportupublicznegoplik_data).  
The dataset includes:  
- **Stops and their geographical locations**  
- **Connections between stops**  
- **Departure and arrival times**  
- **Transit lines operating on these routes**  

The data used in this project is from **March 1, 2023**.  

### Simplifications  
The program assumes that users travel **exclusively by public transport**, as the dataset only includes public transport stops. Therefore, **nearby stops that could be reached on foot are not considered unless directly connected to the current stop**.  

**Stop Merging:** All stops with the same name were merged, and their geographic coordinates were averaged to avoid inefficient routing, e.g., at "Plac Grunwaldzki".

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Features  
The application is primarily designed to search for **public transport connections within Wroc≈Çaw**, with several customization options available:  

### Algorithm Selection  

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- A **classical, optimal**, but **slower** algorithm.  
- **Always optimizes routes based on travel time.**  

#### A\* Algorithm  
- A **heuristic-based, faster** algorithm.  
- Uses heuristics to estimate path costs.  
- **Euclidean distance** is used as a heuristic.  
- Can optimize based on **travel time** or **number of transfers**.  

### Optimization Criteria  

#### Optimization by Travel Time  
- Minimizes the **total travel time**.  
- May lead to **excessive transfers**, as comfort is not considered.  

#### Optimization by Number of Transfers  
- Minimizes both **travel time** and **number of transfers**.  
- Prioritizes staying on the same vehicle, if efficient.  
- **Experimental approach** (described in documentation).  

### Departure Time Selection  
- By default, the program uses **local time**.  
- Users can **select a departure time** to plan trips.  

### Step-by-Step Route Breakdown  
- The algorithm presents data as **route segments**, each representing a single transit line.  
- If a line passes through many stops, users can **expand details** to view intermediate stops.

## üöÄ Application Setup Instructions  
The application was developed using **Python 3.10.9**. If execution fails, using this version is recommended.  

### Installation  
Navigate to the project's main folder (where `main.py` is located) and run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### ‚ö° Running the Application  
The application can be launched with an optional **`--mode`** argument:  
```bash
python main.py --mode console
```
üñ•Ô∏è This starts the **console mode**, which is more difficult to operate than the default **graphical interface**.
